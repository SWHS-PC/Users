# Users

The Users repository contains folders for South Whidbey High School Programming Club
members to put their individual student projects.

Hosting on GitHub means:

*  All of our code is backed up online where we can all see it.
*  All of your changes are tracked, so you can always get back to a past version.
*  We can review and give feedback on changes, which is a great learning tool.

See [Getting Started](Help/Getting-Started.md) for information about installing
tools, cloning the repository, and creating your first program.

This repository uses the [MIT open-source license](LICENSE). Don't add anything 
here that you aren't willing to share.
