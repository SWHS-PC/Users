    <p>Supressing the tremor in your voice, you say to the child,
“Are you OK? Can I help you?”</p>
    <p>The ghostly child looks at you and walks slowly down the
stairs. You back away, trying to keep some distance. At
the bottom of the stairs, the child turns left and walks
towards the corner of the room to your right.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="ghost_follow.html">Follow the child.</a>
