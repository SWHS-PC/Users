    <p>You take a closer look at the grandfather clock. It's not running,
    of course, but you notice something strange. Unlike everything else
    in the room, the clock is free of dust. Could it be concealing some
    clue?</p>

    <p>You open the glass door in the front of the clock. Driven by some
    impulse you don't understand, you start the pendulum swinging. Suddenly,
    the mechanism springs to life! The weights begin descending, and the
    hands start moving rapidly &mdash; backwards!</p>

    <p>A gust of wind makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand
    on end. You look up, and a pale light draws you eyes to the top of
    the stairs, where stands a small figure. A child. No doubt the
    child you heard from outside, for now he calls out again, &ldquo;Help
    me!&rdquo; in a voice that seems to come from a great distance. The
    hilt of a knife protrudes from the child's chest, but there is no
    blood. Indeed the child seems utterly pale and bloodless, and looking
    closer you find you can see right through him.</p>

    <p>In terror, you run for the front door with the child's voice
    crying out behind you. You make it outside and run across the front
    yard, finally looking over your shoulder as you reach the sidewalk.
    You see the child standing in the doorway with ghostly arm outstretched.
    No farther would he follow, it seems. Except in dreams. He still haunts
    you in your dreams.</p>

    <p>THE END</p>
