    </h1>
    <p>You walk through the overgrown yard to the back of the house,
hoping to learn something without actually going inside.
However, all you can see of the house are pealing paint and
darkened windows.</p>
    <p>No wiser, you continue around to the front of the house and
face the front door.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="chicken.html">Chicken out and continue home.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="front_door.html">Open the front door and go in.</a>
      </li>
