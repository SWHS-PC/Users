    </h1>
    <p>You take a closer look at the grandfather clock. It's not
running, of course, but you notice something strange.
Unlike everything else in the room, the clock is free of
dust. Could it be concealing some clue?</p>
    <p>You open the glass door in the front of the clock. Driven
by some impulse you don't understand, you start the pendulum
swinging. Suddenly, the mechanism springs to life! The
weights begin descending, and the hands start moving
rapidly — backwards!</p>
    <p>A gust of wind makes the hairs on the back of your neck
stand on end. You look up, and a pale light draws you eyes
to the top of the stairs. There stands a small figure, a
child. This must be the child you heard from outside, for
now he calls out again, “Help me!” in a voice that seems to
come from a great distance. The hilt of a knife protrudes
from the child's chest, but there is no blood. Indeed the
child seems utterly pale and bloodless, and looking closer
you find you can see right through him.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="ghost_talk.html">Try to talk to the child.</a>
