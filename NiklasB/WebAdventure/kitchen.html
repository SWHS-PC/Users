    <p>You find yourself in an old kitchen with a large cast-iron
stove and many cabinets. You quickly search the cabinets,
hoping to find something useful -- a knife perhaps -- but
they're empty of everything except cobwebs.</p>
    <p>Through a partially-open door in the back of the kitchen,
you can see stairs leading down. Perhaps they lead to a
cellar.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="cellar.html">Go down the stairs.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="entry.html">Return to the entry way.</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
