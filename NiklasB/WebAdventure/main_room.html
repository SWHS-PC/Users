    <p>You're in what must once have been a very elegant room.
Ahead, a grand staircase leads upstairs. Just below the
stairs is a very large grandfather clock. Off to the
side is a grand piano.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="upstairs.html">Go up the stairs.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="clock.html">Inspect the grandfather clock.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="entry.html">Return to the entry way.</a>
