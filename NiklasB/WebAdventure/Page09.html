    <p>At the top of the stairs is a long hallway with doors on either
    side. Heart pounding, you tiptoe down the hall, peaking into
    each of the rooms. You see only rotting bedroom furniture and
    thick dust, long undisturbed.</p>

    <p>No one can have been up here for ages, you decide. The voice
    must have come from somewhere else, unless you imagined it. You
    head back down the stairs.</p>
