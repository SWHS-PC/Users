    <p>Feeling guilty, you pretend not to hear anything and rush home.</p>

    <p>You make it home safe and sound, and you never hear what happened
    in the house that night. But in moments of doubt, you still hear that
    child's voice, and wonder if you might have prevented some horrible
    crime.</p>

    <p>THE END</p>
