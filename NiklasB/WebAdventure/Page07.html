    <p>Mustering your courage, you call out loudly, &ldquo;Hello! Does
    anyone need any help?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>After first you hear nothing, but then you hear a voice nearby to 
    your left. Aiming your flashlight there, you see a small door, which
    you had missed before because it blends into the dark panelling &mdash;
    a closet perhaps.</p>

    <p>Cautiously, you open the door, then laugh as a cat emerges, meowing
    pitiably. It was only a cat you heard all along! You let the cat outside
    and continue home, relieved to be spared any further adventure.</p>

    <p>THE END</p>
