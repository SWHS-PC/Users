    <p>Pushing your way through cobwebs, you walk down the stairs
into the dark cellar. At the bottom, your flashlight catches
something white ahead on the stone floor. As you continue
forward to investigate, the cobwebs around you stir with a
sudden breeze from behind. You hear the door at the top of
the stairs slam shut and a bolt slide ominously into place.</p>
    <p>Now you recognize the white object on the floor: a bone,
part of a small human skeleton. In a panic, you rush back
up the stairs to try the door, but it won't budge. You call
out, but the darkness seems to muffle your voice. Still you
cry desperately for help, continuing even as your flashlight
dims and goes out. You cry out through endless hours of
darkness, growing increasingly parched until your voice
emerges only as a croak. At last you cry no more.</p>
    <p>THE END</p>
