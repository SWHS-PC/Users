    <p>You're in a dark paneled entry way. Behind you is the front
door. To your right is an opening leading to what appears
to be a kitchen. Ahead is a large room, which your puny
flashlight does not illuminate.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="kitchen.html">Go into the kitchen.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="main_room.html">Continue ahead into the large room.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="kitty.html">Call out.</a>
