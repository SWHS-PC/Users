    <p>
        The front door creaks loudly as you open it, and dust falls from
        the ceiling. You sneeze, stirring up more dust, then venture inside.
        The only light is from the open door behind you, but fortunately you
        have a small flashlight in your pocket. You pull it out and turn it on.
