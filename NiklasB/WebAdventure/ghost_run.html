    </h1>
    <p>In terror, you run for the front door with the child's
voice crying out behind you. You make it outside and run
across the front yard, finally looking over your shoulder
as you reach the sidewalk. You see the child standing in
the doorway with a ghostly arm outstretched. No farther
would he follow, it seems. Except in dreams. He still
haunts you in your dreams.</p>
    <p>THE END</p>
