    <h1>The Haunted House</h1>
    <p>You're walking home from school one afternoon in January. It's
late afternoon because you stayed after school for coding club,
and it's already getting dark. As usual, your route takes you
past that creepy abandoned house on your street.</p>
    <p>You hunch your shoulders and start to hurry past, but suddenly
a child's voice calls out from inside, “Help! Help!”</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="chicken.html">Ignore the voice and continue home.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="front_door.html">Run up to the front door and go in.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="back_yard.html">Walk around back.</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
