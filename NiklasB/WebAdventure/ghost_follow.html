    <p>As you approach the child, he passes right through the
front wall of the room. Close inspection reveals a door,
cleverly concealed in the panelling. You've heard that
old houses sometimes have hidden side passages used by
servants. This must be one of those.</p>
    <p>You pull open the door and walk through a narrow passage,
emerging into the kitchen. You can see the child to your
left through an open door. He is on his way downstairs,
perhaps to a cellar. On your right is an opening that
leads to the front entrance.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
