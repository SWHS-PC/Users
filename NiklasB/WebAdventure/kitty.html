    </h1>
    <p>Mustering your courage, you call out loudly, “Hello! Does
someone need help?”</p>
    <p>There is no response at first, but then you hear a high,
wordless voice somewhere on your left. Aiming your flashlight
there, you see a small door, which you had overlooked before
because it blends into the dark panelling — a closet perhaps.</p>
    <p>Cautiously, you open the door, then laugh as a cat emerges,
meowing pitiably. It was only a cat you heard all along!
You let the cat outside and continue home, relieved to be
spared any further adventure.</p>
    <p>THE END</p>
