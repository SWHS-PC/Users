    <p>Mustering your courage, you call out loudly, "Hello! Does
anyone need any help?"</p>
    <p>After first you hear nothing, but then you hear a voice
nearby to your left. Aiming your flashlight there, you see
a small door, which you had missed before because it blends
into the dark panelling -- a closet perhaps.</p>
    <p>Cautiously, you open the door, then laugh as a cat emerges,
meowing pitiably. It was only a cat you heard all along!
You let the cat outside and continue home, relieved to be
spared any further adventure.</p>
    <p>THE END</p>
