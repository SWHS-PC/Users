    <p>You find yourself in an old kitchen with a large cast-iron stove
    and many cabinets. You quickly search the cabinets, hoping to find
    something useful &mdash; a knife perhaps &mdash; but they're empty
    of everything except cobwebs.</p>

    <p>Through a partially-open door in the back of the kitchen, you
    can see stairs leading down. Perhaps they lead to a cellar.</p>

    <p>What do you do?</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="page08.html">Go down the stairs.</a></li>
        <li><a href="page04.html">Return to the entry way.</a></li>
    </ul>
