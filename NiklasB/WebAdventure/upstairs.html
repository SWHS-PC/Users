    </h1>
    <p>At the top of the stairs is a long hallway with doors on
either side. Heart pounding, you tiptoe down the hall,
peaking into each of the rooms. You see only rotting
bedroom furniture and thick dust, long undisturbed.</p>
    <p>No one can have been up here for ages, you decide. The
voice must have come from somewhere else, unless you
imagined it. You head back down the stairs to the large
room with the grandfather clock and the piano.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="clock.html">Inspect the grandfather clock.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="entry.html">Return to the entry way.</a>
