    </h1>
    <p>Feeling guilty, you pretend not to hear anything and rush home.</p>
    <p>You make it home safe and sound, and you never hear what
happened in the house that night. But in moments of doubt, you
still hear that child's voice, and wonder if you might have
prevented some horrible crime.</p>
    <p>THE END</p>
