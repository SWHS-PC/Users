    </h1>
    <p>You follow the child downstairs and find him in the
corner of the cellar looking down. At his feet is a small
human skeleton, a child's skeleton.</p>
    <p>“It's you, isn't it?” you say, “Someone killed you and
hid your body down here.”</p>
    <p>The child looks at you and nods. You promise to find out
what happened and make sure he's properly buried. The
child smiles for the first time and fades away. The room
suddenly feels warmer, and you find that you are no
longer scared.</p>
    <p>The next day, you report what you found to the police,
omitting any mention of ghosts. You learn that a child
lived in that house with his mother and stepfather many
years ago. Soon after the mother died, the stepfather
reported the child missing, claiming he had run away.
He was never heard from again.</p>
    <p>You attend a small funeral for the child a week later.
It is a sad occasion, but you are happy to know that
the boy's spirit has at last found peace.</p>
    <p>THE END</p>
